	abstract = {In recent years, the use of graph based object representation has gained popularity. Simultaneously, graph edit distance emerged as a powerful and flexible graph matching paradigm that can be used to address different tasks in pattern recognition, machine learning, and data mining. The key advantages of graph edit distance are its high degree of flexibility, which makes it applicable to any type of graph, and the fact that one can integrate domain specific knowledge about object similarity by means of specific edit cost functions. Its computational complexity, however, is exponential in the number of nodes of the involved graphs. Consequently, exact graph edit distance is feasible for graphs of rather small size only. In the present paper we introduce a novel algorithm which allows us to approximately, or suboptimally, compute edit distance in a substantially faster way. The proposed algorithm considers only local, rather than global, edge structure during the optimization process. In experiments on different datasets we demonstrate a substantial speed-up of our proposed method over two reference systems. Moreover, it is emprically verified that the accuracy of the suboptimal distance remains sufficiently accurate for various pattern recognition applications.},

Graph edit distance is one of the most widely accepted measures to determine similarities between graphs and has extensive applications in the fields of pattern recognition, computer vision etc. Unfortunately, the problem of graph edit distance computation is {NP}-Hard in general. Accordingly, in this paper we introduce three novel methods to compute the upper and lower bounds for the edit distance between two graphs in polynomial time. Applying these methods, two algorithms {AppFull} and {AppSub} are introduced to perform different kinds of graph search on graph databases. Comprehensive experimental studies are conducted on both real and synthetic datasets to examine various aspects of the methods for bounding graph edit distance. Result shows that these methods achieve good scalability in terms of both the number of graphs and the size of graphs. The effectiveness of these algorithms also confirms the usefulness of using our bounds in filtering and searching of graphs.},

Existing model reduction techniques are either applicable under limited circumstances or produce “black boxes” disconnected from the microscopic physics. We propose a new approach by translating the model reduction problem for an arbitrary statistical model into a geometric problem of constructing a low-dimensional, submanifold approximation to a high-dimensional manifold. When models are overly complex, we use the observation that the model manifold is bounded with a hierarchy of widths and propose using the boundaries as submanifold approximations. We refer to this approach as the manifold boundary approximation method. We apply this method to several models, including a sum of exponentials, a dynamical systems model of protein signaling, and a generalized Ising model. By focusing on parameters rather than physical degrees of freedom, the approach unifies many other model reduction techniques, such as singular limits, equilibrium approximations, and the renormalization group, while expanding the domain of tractable models. The method produces a series of approximations that decrease the complexity of the model and reveal how microscopic parameters are systematically “compressed” into a few macroscopic degrees of freedom, effectively building a bridge between the microscopic and the macroscopic descriptions.},

	abstract = {Parameter estimation by nonlinear least-squares minimization is a common problem that has an elegant geometric interpretation: the possible parameter values of a model induce a manifold within the space of data predictions. The minimization problem is then to find the point on the manifold closest to the experimental data. We show that the model manifolds of a large class of models, known as sloppy models, have many universal features; they are characterized by a geometric series of widths, extrinsic curvatures, and parameter-effect curvatures, which we describe as a hyper-ribbon. A number of common difficulties in optimizing least-squares problems are due to this common geometric structure. First, algorithms tend to run into the boundaries of the model manifold, causing parameters to diverge or become unphysical before they have been optimized. We introduce the model graph as an extension of the model manifold to remedy this problem. We argue that appropriate priors can remove the boundaries and further improve the convergence rates. We show that typical fits will have many evaporated parameters unless the data are very accurately known. Second, “bare” model parameters are usually ill-suited to describing model behavior; cost contours in parameter space tend to form hierarchies of plateaus and long narrow canyons. Geometrically, we understand this inconvenient parametrization as an extremely skewed coordinate basis and show that it induces a large parameter-effect curvature on the manifold. By constructing alternative coordinates based on geodesic motion, we show that these long narrow canyons are transformed in many cases into a single quadratic, isotropic basin. We interpret the modified Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt fitting algorithms as an Euler approximation to geodesic motion in these natural coordinates on the model manifold and the model graph, respectively. By adding a geodesic acceleration adjustment to these algorithms, we alleviate the difficulties from parameter-effect curvature, improving both efficiency and success rates at finding good fits.},

Among all of those measures, structure-based graph distance measures have become the research focus due to their independence of the definition of cost functions. However, existing structure-based graph distance measures have low degree of precision because only node and edge information of graphs are employed in these measures. To improve the precision of graph distance measures, we define substructure abundance vector ({SAV}) to capture more substructure information of a graph. Furthermore, based on {SAV}, we propose unified graph distance measures which are generalization of the existing structure-based graph distance measures. In general, the unified graph distance measures can evaluate graph distance in much finer grain. We also show that unified graph distance measures based on occurrence mapping and some of their variants are metrics. Finally, we apply the unified graph distance metric and its variants to the population evolution analysis and construct distance graphs of marker networks in three populations, which reflect the single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) linkage disequilibrium ({LD}) differences among these populations.},

Here we introduce the translation, describe the historical context of the work, and show a new analysis of the original data. In doing so, we uncovered several surprises that reveal an interesting glimpse into the early history of enzymology. In particular, our reanalysis of Michaelis and Menten?s data using modern computational methods revealed an unanticipated rigor and precision in the original publication and uncovered a sophisticated, comprehensive analysis that has been overlooked in the century since their work was published. Michaelis and Menten not only analyzed initial velocity measurements but also fit their full time course data to the integrated form of the rate equations, including product inhibition, and derived a single global constant to represent all of their data. That constant was not the Michaelis constant, but rather Vmax/Km, the specificity constant times the enzyme concentration (kcat/Km ? E0).},

decomposition approach even more efficient when computing entire kernel

methods that take O(dn3) time per iteration, where d is the size of the
label set. By extending the necessary linear algebra to Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Spaces ({RKHS}) we obtain the same result for d-dimensional edge
kernels, and O(n4) in the infinite-dimensional case; on sparse graphs
these algorithms only take O(n2) time per iteration in all cases. Experiments
on graphs from bioinformatics and other application domains show that
these techniques can speed up computation of the kernel by an order of

Previous work showed for a particular model that useful predictions could be extracted from a fit long before the experimental data constrained the parameters, even to within orders of magnitude. This was attributed to a “sloppy” pattern in the model's parameter sensitivities; the sensitivity eigenvalues were roughly evenly spaced over many decades. Consequently, the model behavior depended effectively on only a few “stiff” parameter combinations. Here we study the converse problem, showing that direct parameter measurements are very inefficient at constraining the model's behavior. To yield effective predictions, such measurements must be very precise and complete; even a single imprecise parameter often destroys predictivity. We also show here that the characteristic sloppy eigenvalue pattern is reproduced in 16 other diverse models from the systems biology literature. The apparent universality of sloppiness suggests that predictions from most models will be very fragile to single uncertain parameters and that collective parameters fits can often yield tight predictions with loose parameters. Together these results argue that focusing on parameter values may be a very inefficient route to useful models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/sec{\textgreater}},

In the analysis of large scale simulations of complex dynamical systems, where the notion of time evolution comes into play, important problems are the identification of slow variables and dynamically meaningful reaction coordinates that capture the long time evolution of the system. In this paper we provide a unifying view of these apparently different tasks, by considering a family of diffusion maps, defined as the embedding of complex (high dimensional) data onto a low dimensional Euclidean space, via the eigenvectors of suitably defined random walks defined on the given datasets. Assuming that the data is randomly sampled from an underlying general probability distribution p ( x ) = e − U ( x ) , we show that as the number of samples goes to infinity, the eigenvectors of each diffusion map converge to the eigenfunctions of a corresponding differential operator defined on the support of the probability distribution. Different normalizations of the Markov chain on the graph lead to different limiting differential operators. Specifically, the normalized graph Laplacian leads to a backward Fokker–Planck operator with an underlying potential of 2 U ( x ) , best suited for spectral clustering. A different anisotropic normalization of the random walk leads to the backward Fokker–Planck operator with the potential U ( x ) , best suited for the analysis of the long time asymptotics of high dimensional stochastic systems governed by a stochastic differential equation with the same potential U ( x ) . Finally, yet another normalization leads to the eigenfunctions of the Laplace–Beltrami (heat) operator on the manifold in which the data resides, best suited for the analysis of the geometry of the dataset regardless of its possibly non-uniform density.},

	abstract = {The edit distance is a basic string similarity measure for many applications such as string searching, text mining, signal processing, bioinformatics and so on. However, its high computational cost often prevents it from being used for a large set of strings like similar string searching. A promising solution for the problem is to approximate the edit distance with low computational cost. However, although there are many methods for approximating the edit distance, most of them are analyzed only theoretically. In fact, most of the methods can evaluate the edit distance only in terms of order notations, and do not conduct any experiment. This is a large obstacle for applying them to real applications. In this study we will first list up existing edit distance approximation methods. Then we compare them by: (i) approximation performances shown by the original authors, (ii) approximation performances re-analyzed by us (concrete values instead of the order notations) and (iii) experimental performances by our implementations.},

At each time step we change one endpoint of a uniformly chosen edge: the new endpoint is chosen by linear preferential attachment. We consider a sequence of edge reconnecting models where the sequence of initial multigraphs is convergent in a sense which is a natural generalization of the notion of convergence of dense graph sequences, defined by Lov\'{a}sz and Szegedy (J. Combin. Theory Ser B 96 (2006) 933–957). We investigate how the limit object evolves under the edge reconnecting dynamics if we rescale time properly: we give the complete characterization of the time evolution of the limit object from its initial state up to the stationary state, which is described in the companion paper (R\'{a}th and Szak\'{a}cs, in press). In our proofs we use the theory of exchangeable arrays, queuing and diffusion processes.

It replaces the p original variables by a smaller number, q, of derived variables, the principal components, which are linear combinations of the original variables. Often, it is possible to retain most of the variability in the original variables with q very much smaller than p. Despite its apparent simplicity, principal component analysis has a number of subtleties, and it has many uses and extensions. A number of choices associated with the technique are briefly discussed, namely, covariance or correlation, how many components, and different normalization constraints, as well as confusion with factor analysis.

Being able to find the intrinsic low-dimensionality in ensembles of graphs can be useful in a variety of modeling contexts, especially when coarse-graining the detailed graph information is of interest. One of the main challenges in mining graph data is the definition of a suitable pairwise similarity metric in the space of graphs. We explore two practical solutions to solving this problem: one based on finding subgraph densities, and one using spectral information. The approach is illustrated on three test data sets (ensembles of graphs); two of these are obtained from standard graph generating algorithms, while the graphs in the third example are sampled as dynamic snapshots from an evolving network simulation.},

It is essential to perform risk-benefit analysis of reengineering alternatives before making a final decision. Simulation provides an effective pragmatic approach to detailed analysis and evaluation of supply chain design and management alternatives. However, the utility of this methodology is hampered by the time and effort required to develop models with sufficient fidelity to the actual supply chain of interest. In this paper, we describe a supply chain modeling framework designed to overcome this difficulty. Using our approach, supply chain models are composed from software components that represent types of supply chain agents (e.g., retailers, manufacturers, transporters), their constituent control elements (e.g., inventory policy), and their interaction protocols (e.g., message types). The underlying library of supply chain modeling components has been derived from analysis of several different supply chains. It provides a reusable base of domain-specific primitives that enables rapid development of customized decision support tools.},

Edges are picked at random. If the two connected individuals hold different opinions then, with probability 1 - α, one imitates the opinion of the other; otherwise (i.e., with probability α), the link between them is broken and one of them makes a new connection to an individual chosen at random (i) from those with the same opinion or (ii) from the network as a whole. The evolution of the system stops when there are no longer any discordant edges connecting individuals with different opinions. Letting ρ be the fraction of voters holding the minority opinion after the evolution stops, we are interested in how ρ depends on α and the initial fraction u of voters with opinion 1. In case (i), there is a critical value αc which does not depend on u, with ρ ≈ u for α {\textgreater} αc and ρ ≈ 0 for α {\textless} αc. In case (ii), the transition point αc(u) depends on the initial density u. For α {\textgreater} αc(u), ρ ≈ u, but for α {\textless} αc(u), we have ρ(α,u) = ρ(α,1/2).

	abstract = {The performance of information processing systems, from artificial neural networks to natural neuronal ensembles, depends heavily on the underlying system architecture. In this study, we compare the performance of parallel and layered network architectures during sequential tasks that require both acquisition and retention of information, thereby identifying tradeoffs between learning and memory processes. During the task of supervised, sequential function approximation, networks produce and adapt representations of external information. Performance is evaluated by statistically analyzing the error in these representations while varying the initial network state, the structure of the external information, and the time given to learn the information. We link performance to complexity in network architecture by characterizing local error landscape curvature. We find that variations in error landscape structure give rise to tradeoffs in performance; these include the ability of the network to maximize accuracy versus minimize inaccuracy and produce specific versus generalizable representations of information. Parallel networks generate smooth error landscapes with deep, narrow minima, enabling them to find highly specific representations given sufficient time. While accurate, however, these representations are difficult to generalize. In contrast, layered networks generate rough error landscapes with a variety of local minima, allowing them to quickly find coarse representations. Although less accurate, these representations are easily adaptable. The presence of measurable performance tradeoffs in both layered and parallel networks has implications for understanding the behavior of a wide variety of natural and artificial learning systems.},

The results show that the reconstructed activity chains are both spatially and temporally accurate, especially in areas of high activity density.

Studies have shown that many common diseases are influenced by interaction of certain genes. {LR} models with quadratic penalization not only correctly characterizes the influential genes along with their interaction structures but also yields additional benefits in handling high-dimensional, discrete factors with a binary response. We illustrate the advantages of using an L2-regularization scheme and compare its performance with that of “multifactor dimensionality reduction” and “{FlexTree},” 2 recent tools for identifying gene–gene interactions. Through simulated and real data sets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms other methods in the identification of the interaction structures as well as prediction accuracy.

We find that the conservation of proteins in distinct topological motifs correlates with the interconnectedness and function of that motif and also depends on the structure of the overall interactome topology. These findings indicate that motifs may represent evolutionary conserved topological units of cellular networks molded in accordance with the specific biological function in which they participate.},

The dynamic behaviours of the model on a homogeneous network and a heterogenous scale-free network are considered, respectively, where the absence of the threshold on the scale-free network is demonstrated. Then, analytical and simulated results are given to show that the proportional immunization strategy to the new model is very effective on scale-free networks. Furthermore, it is shown that the immune density of nodes depends not only on the infectivity between individual persons, but also on the infectivity between persons and mosquitoes. This reveals that the absence of a critical immunization threshold not only is due to the unbounded connectivity fluctuation of the underlying scale-free network, but also is determined by the path of the epidemic spreading.},

Multiway principal component analysis is used to extract the information in the multivariate trajectory data by projecting them onto low-dimensional spaces defined by the latent variables or principal components. This leads to simple monitoring charts, consistent with the philosophy of statistical process control, which are capable of tracking the progress of new batch runs and detecting the occurrence of observable upsets. The approach is contrasted with other approaches which use theoretical or knowledge-based models, and its potential is illustrated using a detailed simulation study of a semibatch reactor for the production of styrene-butadiene latex.},

	abstract = {A set of quantitative analytical data from the alluvial aquifer of the Pisuerga river, located at the north-east of Valladolid (Spain), has been processed by multivariate statistical techniques in order to investigate the evolution of the groundwater composition between two surveys. The original matrix consisted of 16 physico-chemical variables, determined in 32 groundwater samples collected in 32 sampling sites of the aquifer. The surveys were carried out in October 1994, at the end of the irrigation and low water period just before autumn rains, and in April–May 1995 at the beginning of the irrigation and high water period and after the recharge of aquifer. The experimental 64×16 matrix was analysed by Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}), and the resulting Principal Components ({PCs}) and Varimax rotated {PCs} ({VFs}) analysed by means of box and bivariate plots. The exploration of the correlation matrix allowed to uncover strong associations between some variables (sulphate, chloride, hydrogencarbonate, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and electrical conductivity) as well as a lack of association between the others ({pH}, nitrate, and trace metals). {PCA} showed the existence of up to five significant {PCs} which account for 71.39\% of the variance. Two of them can be initially assigned to ‘mineralization’ whereas the other {PCs} are built from variables indicative of pollution. Box and bivariate plots of the two first {PCs} showed that ‘mineralization’ is maintained through surveys and that trace elements increase from the first to the second survey in all zones, as a possible consequence of soil leaching caused by the rise of the groundwater level. Varimax rotation allowed to ‘break up’ the ‘mineralization’ {PC} into two {VFs}, assigned respectively to ‘natural’ mineralization and to ‘saline’ man-made contamination (sodium and chloride). Box and bivariate plots of {VFs} confirmed the existence of a differential ‘natural’ mineralization pattern, now ascribed exclusively to dissolution of geological materials, as well as the presence of a zone with unusually high levels of ‘saline’ contamination attributed to leakages from sanitary systems. The plot of {VFs} also allowed to visualise seasonal variations, identifying a process of dilution of the ‘natural’ mineralization during the recharge of the aquifer, and an increase of the ‘saline’ contamination, assigned to a variety of non-natural causes.},

The results suggest that the variance in neurophysiological measurements, introduced experimentally, was accounted for by two independent principal components. The first, and considerably larger, highlighted an intentional brain system seen in previous studies of verbal fluency. The second identified a distributed brain system including the anterior cingulate and Wernicke's area that reflected monotonic time effects. We propose that this system has an attentional bias.},

	abstract = {Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs—30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers—a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis ({PCA}) and multidimensional scaling ({MDS}), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

The approach is centered around a fundamental result proved by Motzkin and Straus in the mid-1960s, and recently expanded in various ways, which allows us to formulate the maximum clique problem in terms of a standard quadratic program. The attractive feature of this formulation is that a clear one-to-one correspondence exists between the solutions of the quadratic program and those in the original, combinatorial problem. To solve the program we use the so-called replicator equations-a class of straightforward continuous-and discrete-time dynamical systems developed in various branches of theoretical biology. We show how, despite their inherent inability to escape from local solutions, they nevertheless provide experimental results that are competitive with those obtained using more elaborate mean-field annealing heuristics.},

Furthermore, assuming that data points are random samples from a density p(x) = e-U(x) we identify these eigenvectors as discrete approximations of eigenfunctions of a Fokker-Planck operator in a potential 2U(x) with reflecting boundary conditions. Finally, applying known results regarding the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the continuous Fokker-Planck operator, we provide a mathematical justification for the success of spectral clustering and dimensional reduction algorithms based on these first few eigenvectors. This analysis elucidates, in terms of the characteristics of diffusion processes, many empirical findings regarding spectral clustering algorithms.},

Depending on the matching goal, a subset of the mapping is chosen using filters. After our algorithm runs, we expect a human to check and if necessary adjust the results. As a matter of fact, we evaluate the `accuracy' of the algorithm by counting the number of needed adjustments. We conducted a user study, in which our accuracy metric was used to estimate the labor savings that the users could obtain by utilizing our algorithm to obtain an initial matching. Finally, we illustrate how our matching algorithm is deployed as one of several high-level operators in an implemented testbed for managing information models and mappings.},

They enable the application of kernel methods, such as support vector machines, to the analysis and classification of graphs, for example, chemical compounds. These graph kernels are obtained by marginalizing a kernel between paths with respect to a random walk model on the graph vertices along the edges. We propose two extensions of these graph kernels, with the double goal to reduce their computation time and increase their relevance as measure of similarity between graphs. First, we propose to modify the label of each vertex by automatically adding information about its environment with the use of the Morgan algorithm. Second, we suggest a modification of the random walk model to prevent the walk from coming back to a vertex that was just visited. These extensions are then tested on benchmark experiments of chemical compounds classification, with promising results.},

Networked cooperative uninhabited autonomous vehicles are being developed for commercial and military applications. Suppose that we refer to all such groups of entities as "social foraging swarms". In order for such multiagent systems to succeed it is often critical that they can both maintain cohesive behaviors and appropriately respond to environmental stimuli (e.g., by optimizing the acquisition of nutrients in foraging for food). In this paper, we characterize swarm cohesiveness as a stability property and use a Lyapunov approach to develop conditions under which local agent actions will lead to cohesive foraging even in the presence of "noise" characterized by uncertainty on sensing other agent's position and velocity, and in sensing nutrients that each agent is foraging for. The results quantify earlier claims that social foraging is in a certain sense superior to individual foraging when noise is present, and provide clear connections between local agent-agent interactions and emergent group behavior. Moreover, the simulations show that very complicated but orderly group behaviors, reminiscent of those seen in biology, emerge in the presence of noise.},

So far, only very specific graphs such as trees and strings have been considered.This paper investigates kernels on labeled directed graphs with general structure. It is shown that computing a strictly positive definite graph kernel is at least as hard as solving the graph isomorphism problem. It is also shown that computing an inner product in a feature space indexed by all possible graphs, where each feature counts the number of subgraphs isomorphic to that graph, is {NP}-hard. On the other hand, inner products in an alternative feature space, based on walks in the graph, can be computed in polynomial time. Such kernels are defined in this paper.},

	abstract = {The random walk is fundamental to modeling dynamic processes on networks. Metrics based on the random walk have been used in many applications from image processing to Web page ranking. However, how appropriate are random walks to modeling and analyzing social networks? We argue that unlike a random walk, which conserves the quantity diffusing on a network, many interesting social phenomena, such as the spread of information or disease on a social network, are fundamentally non-conservative. When an individual infects her neighbor with a virus, the total amount of infection increases. We classify diffusion processes as conservative and non-conservative and show how these differences impact the choice of metrics used for network analysis, as well as our understanding of network structure and behavior. We show that Alpha-Centrality, which mathematically describes non-conservative diffusion, leads to new insights into the behavior of spreading processes on networks. We give a scalable approximate algorithm for computing the Alpha-Centrality in a massive graph. We validate our approach on real-world online social networks of Digg. We show that a non-conservative metric, such as Alpha-Centrality, produces better agreement with empirical measure of influence than conservative metrics, such as {PageRank}. We hope that our investigation will inspire further exploration into the realms of conservative and non-conservative metrics in social network analysis.},

Our approach is based on a technique for the numerical solution of eigenfunction problems known as the Nystrom method. This method allows one to extrapolate the complete grouping solution using only a small number of samples. In doing so, we leverage the fact that there are far fewer coherent groups in a scene than pixels.},

	abstract = {Highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A viruses are now endemic in avian populations in Southeast Asia, and human cases continue to accumulate. Although currently incapable of sustained human-to-human transmission, H5N1 represents a serious pandemic threat owing to the risk of a mutation or reassortment generating a virus with increased transmissibility. Identifying public health interventions that might be able to halt a pandemic in its earliest stages is therefore a priority. Here we use a simulation model of influenza transmission in Southeast Asia to evaluate the potential effectiveness of targeted mass prophylactic use of antiviral drugs as a containment strategy. Other interventions aimed at reducing population contact rates are also examined as reinforcements to an antiviral-based containment policy. We show that elimination of a nascent pandemic may be feasible using a combination of geographically targeted prophylaxis and social distancing measures, if the basic reproduction number of the new virus is below 1.8. We predict that a stockpile of 3 million courses of antiviral drugs should be sufficient for elimination. Policy effectiveness depends critically on how quickly clinical cases are diagnosed and the speed with which antiviral drugs can be distributed.},

This approach is based on coupling short intervals of direct dynamic network simulation with appropriately-defined lifting and restriction operators, mapping the detailed network description to suitable macroscopic (coarse-grained) variables and back. This enables the acceleration of direct simulations through Coarse Projective Integration ({CPI}), as well as the identification of coarse stationary states via a Newton-{GMRES} method. We also demonstrate the use of data-mining, both linear (principal component analysis, {PCA}) and nonlinear (diffusion maps, {DMAPS}) to determine good macroscopic variables (observables) through which one can coarse-grain the model. These results suggest methods for decreasing simulation times of dynamic real-world systems such as epidemiological network models. Additionally, the data-mining techniques could be applied to a diverse class of problems to search for a succint, low-dimensional description of the system in a small number of variables.},

The existence of a spectral gap for the coupling network graph Laplacian suggests that the graph dynamics may quickly become low dimensional. Our first choice of coarse variables consists of the components of the oscillator states—their (complex) phase angles—along the leading eigenvectors of this Laplacian. We then use the equation-free framework, circumventing the derivation of explicit coarse-grained equations, to perform computational tasks such as coarse projective integration, coarse fixed-point, and coarse limit-cycle computations. In a second step, we explore an approach to incorporating oscillator heterogeneity in the coarse-graining process. The approach is based on the observation of fast-developing correlations between oscillator state and oscillator intrinsic properties and establishes a connection with tools developed in the context of uncertainty quantification.},

However, such algorithms still encounter challenges when faced with real data. One such challenge is the existence of “repeated eigendirections,” which obscures the detection of the true dimensionality of the underlying manifold and arises when several embedding coordinates parametrize the same direction in the intrinsic geometry of the data set. We propose an algorithm, based on local linear regression, to automatically detect coordinates corresponding to repeated eigendirections. We construct a more parsimonious embedding using only the eigenvectors corresponding to unique eigendirections, and we show that this reduced diffusion maps embedding induces a metric which is equivalent to the standard diffusion distance. We first demonstrate the utility and flexibility of our approach on synthetic data sets. We then apply our algorithm to data collected from a stochastic model of cellular chemotaxis, where our approach for factoring out repeated eigendirections allows us to detect changes in dynamical behavior and the underlying intrinsic system dimensionality directly from data.},

Second, we apply this result to the idealized traffic modeling problem of phantom jams generated by cars with uniform behavior on a circular road.  The traffic jams are waves that travel slowly against the direction of traffic. Equation-free analysis enables us to investigate the behavior of the microscopic traffic model on a macroscopic level. The standard deviation of cars' headways is chosen as the macroscopic measure of the underlying dynamics such that traveling wave solutions correspond to equilibria on the macroscopic level in the equation-free setup. The collapse of the traffic jam to the free flow then corresponds to a saddle-node bifurcation of this macroscopic equilibrium.

The theoretical analysis of epidemic spreading in heterogeneous networks requires the development of novel analytical frameworks, and it has produced results of conceptual and practical relevance. A coherent and comprehensive review of the vast research activity concerning epidemic processes is presented, detailing the successful theoretical approaches as well as making their limits and assumptions clear. Physicists, mathematicians, epidemiologists, computer, and social scientists share a common interest in studying epidemic spreading and rely on similar models for the description of the diffusion of pathogens, knowledge, and innovation. For this reason, while focusing on the main results and the paradigmatic models in infectious disease modeling, the major results concerning generalized social contagion processes are also presented. Finally, the research activity at the forefront in the study of epidemic spreading in coevolving, coupled, and time-varying networks is reported.},

	abstract = {Author Summary During the past decade, we learned that the structure of contact networks plays a crucial role in the spread of diseases. Most theoretical studies addressing this issue assume that contact networks are static entities, whereas the actual disease paths continuously reshape based on local social dynamics. This work aims to achieve a better understanding of disease spreading in populations characterized by a dynamically structured contact network where contacts appear and disappear over time. The network dynamics are entangled with the disease dynamics, as individuals may have access to local information that makes them aware of both the existence of the disease and the health status of their contacts, allowing them to minimize exposure to infection. Here we show the equivalence between disease propagation in an adaptive contact network and that in a well-mixed population with a rescaled transmission probability, which depends also on the fraction of infected in the population. Thus, one can emulate the effect of an adaptive contact network with a simple correction of the transmission probability. This result is obtained in the limit where network adaptation proceeds much faster than disease spreading, but we demonstrate that it also holds for a much wider range of scenarios.},

The process may repeat several times before the infection finally vanishes. Simulation results show that all three factors, namely the network growth, the connection breaking, and the isolation avoidance, are necessary for epidemic reemergence to happen. We present a simple theoretical analysis to explain the process of reemergence in detail. Our study may offer some useful insights, helping explain the phenomenon of repeated epidemic explosions.},

	abstract = {The global spread of emergent diseases is inevitably entangled with the structure of the population flows among different geographical regions. The airline transportation network in particular shrinks the geographical space by reducing travel time between the world's most populated areas and defines the main channels along which emergent diseases will spread. In this paper, we investigate the role of the large-scale properties of the airline transportation network in determining the global propagation pattern of emerging diseases. We put forward a stochastic computational framework for the modeling of the global spreading of infectious diseases that takes advantage of the complete International Air Transport Association 2002 database complemented with census population data. The model is analyzed by using for the first time an information theory approach that allows the quantitative characterization of the heterogeneity level and the predictability of the spreading pattern in presence of stochastic fluctuations. In particular we are able to assess the reliability of numerical forecast with respect to the intrinsic stochastic nature of the disease transmission and travel flows. The epidemic pattern predictability is quantitatively determined and traced back to the occurrence of epidemic pathways defining a backbone of dominant connections for the disease spreading. The presented results provide a general computational framework for the analysis of containment policies and risk forecast of global epidemic outbreaks.},

We assume that the infection probability as well as the rewiring probability between agents is type-dependent. Under this assumption we analyze a system of M -type networks with mean-field approximation. These general expressions apply to networks with various choices of infection mechanisms and rewiring rules. We explicitly evaluate the infection level for two-type networks with intratype/intertype infecting and rewiring and investigate their impacts on the epidemic threshold. By plotting the bifurcation diagram for various parameters, we find a bistability region where both the disease-free state and the endemic state co-exist for appropriate rewiring dynamics. The area of each phase depends on the corresponding interaction modes. We show that consistency between infecting and rewiring modes speeds up the disease spread, while inconsistency contributes to halting the outbreak.},

The graphs are generated by large-scale individual-based urban traffic simulations built on actual census, land-use and population-mobility data. We find that the contact network among people is a strongly connected small-world-like graph with a well-defined scale for the degree distribution. However, the locations graph is scale-free, which allows highly efficient outbreak detection by placing sensors in the hubs of the locations network. Within this large-scale simulation framework, we then analyse the relative merits of several proposed mitigation strategies for smallpox spread. Our results suggest that outbreaks can be contained by a strategy of targeted vaccination combined with early detection without resorting to mass vaccination of a population.},

Detailed individual-based mathematical models on complex networks play an important role towards this aim. In this work, it is shown how one can exploit the Equation-Free approach and optimization methods such as Simulated Annealing to bridge detailed individual-based epidemic models with coarse-grained, system-level analysis within a pair-wise representation perspective. The proposed computational methodology provides a systematic approach for analyzing the parametric behavior of complex/multiscale epidemic simulators much more efficiently than simply simulating forward in time. It is shown how steady state and (if required) time-dependent computations, stability computations, as well as continuation and numerical bifurcation analysis can be performed in a straightforward manner. The approach is illustrated through a simple individual-based {SIRS} epidemic model deploying on a random regular connected graph. Using the individual-based simulator as a black box coarse-grained timestepper and with the aid of Simulated Annealing I compute the coarse-grained equilibrium bifurcation diagram and analyze the stability of the stationary states sidestepping the necessity of obtaining explicit closures at the macroscopic level.},

Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon, (popularly known as six degrees of separation). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

However, the original formulation contained some mathematical inconsistencies that limited the utility of the model. In particular, the applicability of the model was restricted to flows that are statistically homogeneous in at least one direction. These inconsistencies and limitations are discussed and a new formulation that rectifies them is proposed. The new formulation leads to an integral equation whose solution yields the model coefficient as a function of position and time. The method can be applied to general inhomogeneous flows and does not suffer from the mathematical inconsistencies inherent in the previous formulation.

In his attempts to provide biologically plausible explanations of the function of the central nervous system, he investigated relatively simple networks that were amenable to analysis and more complex networks whose behavior could be predicted only in terms of gross characteristics. He assembled a sizable group involving theoreticians, experimentalists, technologists, and, later, biologists.

The extent to which the conclusions drawn from the analysis of such proteins, which fold on the microsecond timescale, apply to the millisecond or slower folding of naturally occurring proteins is, however, unclear. As a first attempt to address this outstanding issue, we examine here the folding of ubiquitin, a 76-residue-long protein found in all eukaryotes that is known experimentally to fold on a millisecond timescale. Ubiquitin folding has been the subject of many experimental studies, but its slow folding rate has made it difficult to observe and characterize the folding process through all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Here we determine the mechanism, thermodynamics, and kinetics of ubiquitin folding through equilibrium atomistic simulations. The picture emerging from the simulations is in agreement with a view of ubiquitin folding suggested from previous experiments. Our findings related to the folding of ubiquitin are also consistent, for the most part, with the folding principles derived from the simulation of fast-folding proteins, suggesting that these principles may be applicable to a wider range of proteins.},

A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

  a popular technique for finding and annotating conserved genome

  algorithms find alignments by expanding around short runs of

  matching bases with no substitutions or other differences.

  Unfortunately, exact matches that are short enough to occur often in

  significant alignments also occur frequently by chance in the

  background sequence. Thus, these algorithms must trade off between

  efficiency and sensitivity to features without long exact

  matches.Results: We introduce a new algorithm, lsh-all-pairs,

  to find ungapped local alignments in genomic sequence with up to a

  specified fraction of substitutions. The length and substitution

  rate of these alignments can be chosen so that they appear

  frequently in significant similarities yet still remain rare in the

  background sequence. The algorithm finds ungapped alignments

  efficiently using a randomized search technique, locality-sensitive hashing. We have found lsh-all-pairsto be both efficient and sensitive for

  finding local similarities with as little as 63\% identity in

	abstract = {Truncated singular value decomposition ({TSVD}) techniques have been widely used in inversion. The method of truncation determines the quality of a truncated {SVD} solution, but truncation has often been done arbitrarily. The first workable criterion for truncation was based on F-statistical testing, but has only rarely been used in geophysical inversion. Recently, the L-curve approach was proposed for the same purpose, and soon found many applications in interdisciplinary inverse problems. Up to the present, very little has been known of the solution quality using these two workable criteria. We have thus proposed in this paper a new quality-based method for truncation. Six {TSVD} estimators have been investigated for comparison in regularizing discrete unstably ill-posed problems, based on the statistically frequently used F-statistic, the L-curve and our new quality-based mean squared error ({MSE}) criteria. The three F-statistic-based {TSVD} estimators tested can indeed marginally improve the least squares ({LS}) solution to the ill-posed downward continuation problem in the sense of long-term averaging, depending on pre-selected significance levels. The simulations have shown that estimators of this type can hardly guarantee the improvement of the condition number of the linearized unstably ill-posed system. In other words, F-statistic criterion can frequently lead to incorrect discardings of components. The {TSVD} estimator by means of an L-curve is the best in (over)stabilizing ill-posed problems, but results in an over-discarding of components. It is extremely poor in terms of biases and mean squared error ({MSE}) roots of the solution. The quality-based {TSVD} estimator with the basic ridge estimate of x as its initial value has outperformed the other two {TSVD} techniques tested in terms of solution stability, bias and {MSE}. The simulations have clearly shown significant quality advantages of the new method. The simulations have also indicated that the new method is able to achieve a mean accuracy of 5mgal for gravity anomalies from satellite gradiometry, if the few largest biases are left out of the computation.},

When correlations are introduced between the firing times of these input neurons, the distribution of synaptic strengths shows interesting, and apparently low-dimensional, dynamical behaviour. This behaviour is analysed in two different parameter regimes using equation-free techniques, which bypass the explicit derivation of the relevant low-dimensional dynamical system.

The Ras pathway patterns the poles of the Drosophila embryo by downregulating the levels and activity of a {DNA}-binding transcriptional repressor Capicua (Cic). We demonstrate that the spatiotemporal pattern of Cic during this signaling event can be harnessed for functional studies of mutations in the Ras pathway in human diseases. Our approach relies on a new microfluidic device that enables parallel imaging of Cic dynamics in dozens of live embryos. We found that although the pattern of Cic in early embryos is complex, it can be accurately approximated by a product of one spatial profile and one time-dependent amplitude. Analysis of these functions of space and time alone reveals the differential effects of mutations within the Ras pathway. Given the highly conserved nature of Ras-dependent control of Cic, our approach provides new opportunities for functional analysis of multiple sequence variants from developmental abnormalities and cancers.},

	abstract = {This tutorial explains the foundation of approximate Bayesian computation ({ABC}), an approach to Bayesian inference that does not require the specification of a likelihood function, and hence that can be used to estimate posterior distributions of parameters for simulation-based models. We discuss briefly the philosophy of Bayesian inference and then present several algorithms for {ABC}. We then apply these algorithms in a number of examples. For most of these examples, the posterior distributions are known, and so we can compare the estimated posteriors derived from {ABC} to the true posteriors and verify that the algorithms recover the true posteriors accurately. We also consider a popular simulation-based model of recognition memory ({REM}) for which the true posteriors are unknown. We conclude with a number of recommendations for applying {ABC} methods to solve real-world problems.},

Solutions for such large systems of equations must be effected by means of digital computers using appropriately designed codes. This paper addresses itself to the critically important problem of how sensitive the solutions are to variations of, or inherent uncertainties in, the parameters of the equation set. We review here, and also present further developments of, our statistical method of sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis presented here is nonlinear and thus permits one to study the effects of large deviations from the nominal parameter values. In addition, since all parameters are varied simultaneously, one can explore regions of parameter space where several parameters deviate simultaneously from their nominal values. We develop here the theory of our method of sensitivity analysis, then detail the method of implementation, and finally present examples of its use.},

The most popular {SA} practice seen in the literature is that of ’one-factor-at-a-time’ ({OAT}). This consists of analyzing the effect of varying one model input factor at a time while keeping all other fixed. While the shortcomings of {OAT} are known from the statistical literature, its widespread use among modelers raises concern on the quality of the associated sensitivity analyses. The present paper introduces a novel geometric proof of the inefficiency of {OAT}, with the purpose of providing the modeling community with a convincing and possibly definitive argument against {OAT}. Alternatives to {OAT} are indicated which are based on statistical theory, drawing from experimental design, regression analysis and sensitivity analysis proper.},

Planners are typically faced with a wide range of predicted changes from different models of unknown relative quality, owing to large but unquantified uncertainties in the modelling process. Here we report a systematic attempt to determine the range of climate changes consistent with these uncertainties, based on a 53-member ensemble of model versions constructed by varying model parameters. We estimate a probability density function for the sensitivity of climate to a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, and obtain a 5–95 per cent probability range of 2.4–5.4 °C. Our probability density function is constrained by objective estimates of the relative reliability of different model versions, the choice of model parameters that are varied and their uncertainty ranges, specified on the basis of expert advice. Our ensemble produces a range of regional changes much wider than indicated by traditional methods based on scaling the response patterns of an individual simulation.},

	abstract = {We study a stochastic nonlocal partial differential equation, arising in the context of modelling spatially distributed neural activity, which is capable of sustaining stationary and moving spatially localized 'activity bumps'. This system is known to undergo a pitchfork bifurcation in bump speed as a parameter (the strength of adaptation) is changed; yet increasing the noise intensity effectively slowed the motion of the bump. Here we study the system from the point of view of describing the high-dimensional stochastic dynamics in terms of the effective dynamics of a single scalar 'coarse' variable, i.e. reducing the dimensionality of the system. We show that such a reduced description in the form of an effective Langevin equation characterized by a double-well potential is quantitatively successful. The effective potential can be extracted using short, appropriately initialized bursts of direct simulation, and the effects of changing parameters on this potential can easily be studied. We demonstrate this approach in terms of (a) an experience-based 'intelligent' choice of the coarse variable and (b) a variable obtained through data-mining direct simulation results, using a diffusion map approach.},

Being able to find the intrinsic low-dimensionality in ensembles of graphs can be useful in a variety of modeling contexts, especially when coarse-graining the detailed graph information is of interest. One of the main challenges in mining graph data is the definition of a suitable pairwise similarity metric in the space of graphs. We explore two practical solutions to solving this problem: one based on finding subgraph densities, and one using spectral information. The approach is illustrated on three test data sets (ensembles of graphs); two of these are obtained from standard graph generating algorithms, while the graphs in the third example are sampled as dynamic snapshots from an evolving network simulation. We further incorporate these approaches with equation free techniques, demonstrating how such data mining approaches can enhance scientific computation of network evolution dynamics.},

	abstract = {Methods and equations for analysing the kinetics of enzyme-catalysed reactions were developed at the beginning of the 20th century in two centres in particular; in Paris, by Victor Henri, and, in Berlin, by Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten. Henri made a detailed analysis of the work in this area that had preceded him, and arrived at a correct equation for the initial rate of reaction. However, his approach was open to the important objection that he took no account of the hydrogen-ion concentration (a subject largely undeveloped in his time). In addition, although he wrote down an expression for the initial rate of reaction and described the hyperbolic form of its dependence on the substrate concentration, he did not appreciate the great advantages that would come from analysis in terms of initial rates rather than time courses. Michaelis and Menten not only placed Henri's analysis on a firm experimental foundation, but also defined the experimental protocol that remains standard today. Here, we review this development, and discuss other scientific contributions of these individuals. The three parts have different authors, as indicated, and do not necessarily agree on all details, in particular about the relative importance of the contributions of Michaelis and Menten on the one hand and of Henri on the other. Rather than force the review into an unrealistic consensus, we consider it appropriate to leave the disagreements visible.},

	shorttitle = {Hessian eigenmaps},
	abstract = {We describe a method for recovering the underlying parametrization of scattered data (mi) lying on a manifold M embedded in high-dimensional Euclidean space. The method, Hessian-based locally linear embedding, derives from a conceptual framework of local isometry in which the manifold M, viewed as a Riemannian submanifold of the ambient Euclidean space ℝn, is locally isometric to an open, connected subset Θ of Euclidean space ℝd. Because Θ does not have to be convex, this framework is able to handle a significantly wider class of situations than the original {ISOMAP} algorithm. The theoretical framework revolves around a quadratic form ℋ(f) = ∫M ∥Hf(m)∥dm defined on functions f : M ↦ ℝ. Here Hf denotes the Hessian of f, and ℋ(f) averages the Frobenius norm of the Hessian over M. To define the Hessian, we use orthogonal coordinates on the tangent planes of M. The key observation is that, if M truly is locally isometric to an open, connected subset of ℝd, then ℋ(f) has a (d + 1)-dimensional null space consisting of the constant functions and a d-dimensional space of functions spanned by the original isometric coordinates. Hence, the isometric coordinates can be recovered up to a linear isometry. Our method may be viewed as a modification of locally linear embedding and our theoretical framework as a modification of the Laplacian eigenmaps framework, where we substitute a quadratic form based on the Hessian in place of one based on the Laplacian.},

The main idea is to define a system of coordinates with an explicit metric that reflects the connectivity of a given data set and that is robust to noise. Our construction, which is based on a Markov random walk on the data, offers a general scheme of simultaneously reorganizing and subsampling graphs and arbitrarily shaped data sets in high dimensions using intrinsic geometry. We show that clustering in embedding spaces is equivalent to compressing operators. The objective of data partitioning and clustering is to coarse-grain the random walk on the data while at the same time preserving a diffusion operator for the intrinsic geometry or connectivity of the data set up to some accuracy. We show that the quantization distortion in diffusion space bounds the error of compression of the operator, thus giving a rigorous justification for k-means clustering in diffusion space and a precise measure of the performance of general clustering algorithms.},

We consider a sequence of edge reconnecting models where the sequence of initial multigraphs is convergent in a sense which is a natural generalization of the notion of convergence of dense graph sequences, defined by Lovasz and Szegedy in {arXiv}:math/0408173. We investigate how the limit object evolves under the edge reconnecting dynamics if we rescale time properly: we give the complete characterization of the time evolution of the limit object from its initial state up to the stationary state, which is described in the companion paper {arXiv}:1106.2058. In our proofs we use the theory of exchangeable arrays, queuing and diffusion processes. The number of parallel edges and the degrees evolve on different timescales and because of this the model exhibits subaging.},

We present a data-driven method based on alternating products of diffusion operators and show that it extracts the common source of variability. Moreover, we show that it extracts the common source of variability in a multi-sensor experiment as if it were a standard manifold learning algorithm used to analyze a simple single-sensor experiment, in which the common source of variability is the only source of variability.},

In this chapter, we discuss the fundamental principles of multi-objective optimization, the differences between multi-objective optimization and single-objective optimization, and describe a few well-known classical and evolutionary algorithms for multi-objective optimization. Two application case studies reveal the importance of multi-objective optimization in practice. A number of research challenges are then highlighted. The chapter concludes by suggesting a few tricks of the trade and mentioning some key resources to the field of multi-objective optimization.},

The Characteristics of the most significant methods are summarized. Conclusions are drawn that reflect often-neglected ideas and applicability to engineering problems. It is found that no single approach is superior.

Typically, algorithms get lost in regions of parameter space in which the model is unresponsive to changes in parameters, and one is left to make adjustments by hand. We explain this difficulty by interpreting the fitting process as a generalized interpolation procedure. By considering the manifold of all model predictions in data space, we find that cross sections have a hierarchy of widths and are typically very narrow. Algorithms become stuck as they move near the boundaries. We observe that the model manifold, in addition to being tightly bounded, has low extrinsic curvature, leading to the use of geodesics in the fitting process. We improve the convergence of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm by adding geodesic acceleration to the usual step.},

In this paper, we propose a novel network embedding method called the "{LINE}," which is suitable for arbitrary types of information networks: undirected, directed, and/or weighted. The method optimizes a carefully designed objective function that preserves both the local and global network structures. An edge-sampling algorithm is proposed that addresses the limitation of the classical stochastic gradient descent and improves both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the inference. Empirical experiments prove the effectiveness of the {LINE} on a variety of real-world information networks, including language networks, social networks, and citation networks. The algorithm is very efficient, which is able to learn the embedding of a network with millions of vertices and billions of edges in a few hours on a typical single machine.

Obtaining reduced, small size accurate models in terms of these few statistical observables--that is, trying to coarse-grain the full network epidemic model to a small but useful macroscopic one--is even more daunting. Here we describe a data-based approach to solving the first challenge: the detection of a few informative collective observables of the detailed epidemic dynamics. This is accomplished through Diffusion Maps ({DMAPS}), a recently developed data-mining technique. We illustrate the approach through simulations of a simple mathematical model of epidemics on a network: a model known to exhibit complex temporal dynamics.
