\chapter{Introduction\label{ch:intro}}

Machine learning has been used in a vast array of contexts. Principal
component analysis has been used to analyze PET scans \cite{Functional
  Connectivity: The Principal-Component Analysis of Large (PET) Data
  Sets}, to predict traffice flow \cite{Forecasting Approach for
  Short-term Traffic Flow based on Principal Component Analysis and
  Combined Neural Network}, and to examine groundwater composition
\cite{Temporal evolution of groundwater composition in an alluvial
  aquifer (Pisuerga River, Spain) by principal component analysis},
among an array of other novel applications \cite{Principal component
  analysis of molecular dynamics: On the use of Cartesian vs. internal
  coordinates; Monitoring batch processes using multiway principal
  component analysis; Forecasting Using Principal Components From a
  Large Number of Predictors}.

% The following chapters are a test of the theory that engineering
% theses are never read, neither by their advisor nor original
% author. Instead, the theory asserts that the author vomits the
% document into existence in a violent storm of anxiety and
% anticipation, never to be perused again.

% There are those that do brave battle with the big data and there are
% those that survey the wasted battlefield, strewn with broken
% algorithms and bad statistics, and run towards the siren sound of
% Excel. But there is no escape. Some of the warrior's
% deeds were recorded so that future generations would know the folly of
% csv files; the following documents were recovered from the battlefield
% of nonlinearities. Let them be a lesson to all.

% It is not uncommon for the modern researcher to pore over his
% gigabytes of data and question what it is all for.

% Should your data remain big for over six hours after reading this
% thesis, please consult your nearest graduate student.

% Modern researchers are often confronted by the unnecessarry bigness
% of their datasets and wish to make them smaller. This can occur for a
% variety of reasons. 

% Despite growing demand for algorithms that work good, scientists
% are unable to make them good.

% It is no secret that big data requires big algorithms.
