\section{Outline of thesis}

We begin with a background of the mathematical techniques used
throughout the bulk of the thesis work, including manifold learning
algorithms and the Equation Free framework. With this foundation
established, we turn to an extension of these techniques into the
field of network science. In particular, we implement a coarse
stationary state solver...
