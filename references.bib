	abstract = {In recent years, evaluating graph distance has become more and more important in a variety of real applications and many graph distance measures have been proposed. Among all of those measures, structure-based graph distance measures have become the research focus due to their independence of the definition of cost functions. However, existing structure-based graph distance measures have low degree of precision because only node and edge information of graphs are employed in these measures. To improve the precision of graph distance measures, we define substructure abundance vector (SAV) to capture more substructure information of a graph. Furthermore, based on SAV, we propose unified graph distance measures which are generalization of the existing structure-based graph distance measures. In general, the unified graph distance measures can evaluate graph distance in much finer grain. We also show that unified graph distance measures based on occurrence mapping and some of their variants are metrics. Finally, we apply the unified graph distance metric and its variants to the population evolution analysis and construct distance graphs of marker networks in three populations, which reflect the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) linkage disequilibrium (LD) differences among these populations.},

	abstract = {We present a unified framework to study graph kernels, special cases
of which include the random walk (Gärtner et al., 2003; Borgwardt et al., 2005)
and marginalized (Kashima et al., 2003, 2004; Mahét al., 2004) 
graph kernels. Through reduction to a Sylvester equation we improve the
time complexity of kernel computation between unlabeled graphs with 
n vertices from O(n6) to O(n3). We find a spectral
decomposition approach even more efficient when computing entire kernel
matrices. For labeled graphs we develop conjugate gradient and fixed-point
methods that take O(dn3) time per iteration, where d is the size of the
label set. By extending the necessary linear algebra to Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) we obtain the same result for d-dimensional edge
kernels, and O(n4) in the infinite-dimensional case; on sparse graphs
these algorithms only take O(n2) time per iteration in all cases. Experiments
on graphs from bioinformatics and other application domains show that
these techniques can speed up computation of the kernel by an order of
magnitude or more. We also show that certain rational kernels
(Cortes et al., 2002, 2003, 2004) when specialized to graphs
reduce to our random walk graph kernel. Finally, we relate our
framework to R-convolution kernels (Haussler, 1999) and provide a
kernel that is close to the optimal assignment kernel of
kernel of Fröhlich et al. (2006) yet provably positive semi-definite.},

Detailed individual-based mathematical models on complex networks play an important role towards this aim. In this work, it is shown how one can exploit the Equation-Free approach and optimization methods such as Simulated Annealing to bridge detailed individual-based epidemic models with coarse-grained, system-level analysis within a pair-wise representation perspective. The proposed computational methodology provides a systematic approach for analyzing the parametric behavior of complex/multiscale epidemic simulators much more efficiently than simply simulating forward in time. It is shown how steady state and (if required) time-dependent computations, stability computations, as well as continuation and numerical bifurcation analysis can be performed in a straightforward manner. The approach is illustrated through a simple individual-based SIRS epidemic model deploying on a random regular connected graph. Using the individual-based simulator as a black box coarse-grained timestepper and with the aid of Simulated Annealing I compute the coarse-grained equilibrium bifurcation diagram and analyze the stability of the stationary states sidestepping the necessity of obtaining explicit closures at the macroscopic level.},

Graph edit distance is one of the most widely accepted measures to determine similarities between graphs and has extensive applications in the fields of pattern recognition, computer vision etc. Unfortunately, the problem of graph edit distance computation is NP-Hard in general. Accordingly, in this paper we introduce three novel methods to compute the upper and lower bounds for the edit distance between two graphs in polynomial time. Applying these methods, two algorithms AppFull and AppSub are introduced to perform different kinds of graph search on graph databases. Comprehensive experimental studies are conducted on both real and synthetic datasets to examine various aspects of the methods for bounding graph edit distance. Result shows that these methods achieve good scalability in terms of both the number of graphs and the size of graphs. The effectiveness of these algorithms also confirms the usefulness of using our bounds in filtering and searching of graphs.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the use of graph based object representation has gained popularity. Simultaneously, graph edit distance emerged as a powerful and flexible graph matching paradigm that can be used to address different tasks in pattern recognition, machine learning, and data mining. The key advantages of graph edit distance are its high degree of flexibility, which makes it applicable to any type of graph, and the fact that one can integrate domain specific knowledge about object similarity by means of specific edit cost functions. Its computational complexity, however, is exponential in the number of nodes of the involved graphs. Consequently, exact graph edit distance is feasible for graphs of rather small size only. In the present paper we introduce a novel algorithm which allows us to approximately, or suboptimally, compute edit distance in a substantially faster way. The proposed algorithm considers only local, rather than global, edge structure during the optimization process. In experiments on different datasets we demonstrate a substantial speed-up of our proposed method over two reference systems. Moreover, it is emprically verified that the accuracy of the suboptimal distance remains sufficiently accurate for various pattern recognition applications.},

	abstract = {A central problem in data analysis is the low dimensional representation of high dimensional data and the concise description of its underlying geometry and density. In the analysis of large scale simulations of complex dynamical systems, where the notion of time evolution comes into play, important problems are the identification of slow variables and dynamically meaningful reaction coordinates that capture the long time evolution of the system. In this paper we provide a unifying view of these apparently different tasks, by considering a family of diffusion maps, defined as the embedding of complex (high dimensional) data onto a low dimensional Euclidean space, via the eigenvectors of suitably defined random walks defined on the given datasets. Assuming that the data is randomly sampled from an underlying general probability distribution p ( x ) = e − U ( x ) , we show that as the number of samples goes to infinity, the eigenvectors of each diffusion map converge to the eigenfunctions of a corresponding differential operator defined on the support of the probability distribution. Different normalizations of the Markov chain on the graph lead to different limiting differential operators. Specifically, the normalized graph Laplacian leads to a backward Fokker–Planck operator with an underlying potential of 2 U ( x ) , best suited for spectral clustering. A different anisotropic normalization of the random walk leads to the backward Fokker–Planck operator with the potential U ( x ) , best suited for the analysis of the long time asymptotics of high dimensional stochastic systems governed by a stochastic differential equation with the same potential U ( x ) . Finally, yet another normalization leads to the eigenfunctions of the Laplace–Beltrami (heat) operator on the manifold in which the data resides, best suited for the analysis of the geometry of the dataset regardless of its possibly non-uniform density.},

However, the utility of this methodology is hampered by the time and effort required to develop models with sufficient fidelity to the actual supply chain of interest. In this paper, we describe a supply chain modeling framework designed to overcome this difficulty. Using our approach, supply chain models are composed from software components that represent types of supply chain agents (e.g., retailers, manufacturers, transporters), their constituent control elements (e.g., inventory policy), and their interaction protocols (e.g., message types). The underlying library of supply chain modeling components has been derived from analysis of several different supply chains.

Understanding transmission of these viruses necessitates taking into account their evolution, which represents a challenge for developing mathematical models.

RESULTS: Here, we develop an Individual-Based Model (IBM) in order to address simultaneously the ecology, epidemiology and evolution of strain-polymorphic pathogens, using Influenza A viruses as an illustrative example.

Edges are picked at random. If the two connected individuals hold different opinions then, with probability 1 - α, one imitates the opinion of the other; otherwise (i.e., with probability α), the link between them is broken and one of them makes a new connection to an individual chosen at random (i) from those with the same opinion or (ii) from the network as a whole. The evolution of the system stops when there are no longer any discordant edges connecting individuals with different opinions. Letting ρ be the fraction of voters holding the minority opinion after the evolution stops, we are interested in how ρ depends on α and the initial fraction u of voters with opinion 1. In case (i), there is a critical value αc which does not depend on u, with ρ ≈ u for α {\textgreater} αc and ρ ≈ 0 for α {\textless} αc. In case (ii), the transition point αc(u) depends on the initial density u. For α {\textgreater} αc(u), ρ ≈ u, but for α {\textless} αc(u), we have ρ(α,u) = ρ(α,1/2). Using simulations and approximate calculations, we explain why these two nearly identical models have such dramatically different phase transitions.},

	abstract = {The performance of information processing systems, from artificial neural networks to natural neuronal ensembles, depends heavily on the underlying system architecture. In this study, we compare the performance of parallel and layered network architectures during sequential tasks that require both acquisition and retention of information, thereby identifying tradeoffs between learning and memory processes. During the task of supervised, sequential function approximation, networks produce and adapt representations of external information. Performance is evaluated by statistically analyzing the error in these representations while varying the initial network state, the structure of the external information, and the time given to learn the information. We link performance to complexity in network architecture by characterizing local error landscape curvature. We find that variations in error landscape structure give rise to tradeoffs in performance; these include the ability of the network to maximize accuracy versus minimize inaccuracy and produce specific versus generalizable representations of information. Parallel networks generate smooth error landscapes with deep, narrow minima, enabling them to find highly specific representations given sufficient time. While accurate, however, these representations are difficult to generalize. In contrast, layered networks generate rough error landscapes with a variety of local minima, allowing them to quickly find coarse representations. Although less accurate, these representations are easily adaptable. The presence of measurable performance tradeoffs in both layered and parallel networks has implications for understanding the behavior of a wide variety of natural and artificial learning systems.},

The simulated activities were compared with the actual observed activities of 5,196 vehicles that were inferred from Global Positioning System logs covering approximately 6 months. The results show that the reconstructed activity chains are both spatially and temporally accurate, especially in areas of high activity density. Freight vehicles are a major contributor to traffic congestion and emissions, and the new approach bridges the gap between the person and the state of the art in commercial transport modeling.},

Often, it is possible to retain most of the variability in the original variables with q very much smaller than p. Despite its apparent simplicity, principal component analysis has a number of subtleties, and it has many uses and extensions. A number of choices associated with the technique are briefly discussed, namely, covariance or correlation, how many components, and different normalization constraints, as well as confusion with factor analysis.

Being able to find the intrinsic low-dimensionality in ensembles of graphs can be useful in a variety of modeling contexts, especially when coarse-graining the detailed graph information is of interest. One of the main challenges in mining graph data is the definition of a suitable pairwise similarity metric in the space of graphs. We explore two practical solutions to solving this problem: one based on finding subgraph densities, and one using spectral information. The approach is illustrated on three test data sets (ensembles of graphs); two of these are obtained from standard graph generating algorithms, while the graphs in the third example are sampled as dynamic snapshots from an evolving network simulation.},

We investigate how the limit object evolves under the edge reconnecting dynamics if we rescale time properly: we give the complete characterization of the time evolution of the limit object from its initial state up to the stationary state, which is described in the companion paper (Ráth and Szakács, in press).

The existence of a spectral gap for the coupling network graph Laplacian suggests that the graph dynamics may quickly become low dimensional. Our first choice of coarse variables consists of the components of the oscillator states—their (complex) phase angles—along the leading eigenvectors of this Laplacian. We then use the equation-free framework, circumventing the derivation of explicit coarse-grained equations, to perform computational tasks such as coarse projective integration, coarse fixed-point, and coarse limit-cycle computations. In a second step, we explore an approach to incorporating oscillator heterogeneity in the coarse-graining process. The approach is based on the observation of fast-developing correlations between oscillator state and oscillator intrinsic properties and establishes a connection with tools developed in the context of uncertainty quantification.},

However, its high computational cost often prevents it from being used for a large set of strings like similar string searching. A promising solution for the problem is to approximate the edit distance with low computational cost. However, although there are many methods for approximating the edit distance, most of them are analyzed only theoretically. In fact, most of the methods can evaluate the edit distance only in terms of order notations, and do not conduct any experiment. This is a large obstacle for applying them to real applications. In this study we will first list up existing edit distance approximation methods.

Second, we apply this result to the idealized traffic modeling problem of phantom jams generated by cars with uniform behavior on a circular road.  The traffic jams are waves that travel slowly against the direction of traffic. Equation-free analysis enables us to investigate the behavior of the microscopic traffic model on a macroscopic level. The standard deviation of cars' headways is chosen as the macroscopic measure of the underlying dynamics such that traveling wave solutions correspond to equilibria on the macroscopic level in the equation-free setup. The collapse of the traffic jam to the free flow then corresponds to a saddle-node bifurcation of this macroscopic equilibrium. We continue this bifurcation in two parameters using equation-free analysis.},

However, such algorithms still encounter challenges when faced with real data. One such challenge is the existence of “repeated eigendirections,” which obscures the detection of the true dimensionality of the underlying manifold and arises when several embedding coordinates parametrize the same direction in the intrinsic geometry of the data set. We propose an algorithm, based on local linear regression, to automatically detect coordinates corresponding to repeated eigendirections. We construct a more parsimonious embedding using only the eigenvectors corresponding to unique eigendirections, and we show that this reduced diffusion maps embedding induces a metric which is equivalent to the standard diffusion distance. We first demonstrate the utility and flexibility of our approach on synthetic data sets. We then apply our algorithm to data collected from a stochastic model of cellular chemotaxis, where our approach for factoring out repeated eigendirections allows us to detect changes in dynamical behavior and the underlying intrinsic system dimensionality directly from data.},

Being able to find the intrinsic low-dimensionality in ensembles of graphs can be useful in a variety of modeling contexts, especially when coarse-graining the detailed graph information is of interest. One of the main challenges in mining graph data is the definition of a suitable pairwise similarity metric in the space of graphs. We explore two practical solutions to solving this problem: one based on finding subgraph densities, and one using spectral information. The approach is illustrated on three test data sets (ensembles of graphs); two of these are obtained from standard graph generating algorithms, while the graphs in the third example are sampled as dynamic snapshots from an evolving network simulation.},

	abstract = {We present a computer-assisted approach to coarse graining the evolutionary dynamics of a system of nonidentical oscillators coupled through a (fixed) network structure. The existence of a spectral gap for the coupling network graph Laplacian suggests that the graph dynamics may quickly become low dimensional. Our first choice of coarse variables consists of the components of the oscillator states—their (complex) phase angles—along the leading eigenvectors of this Laplacian. We then use the equation-free framework, circumventing the derivation of explicit coarse-grained equations, to perform computational tasks such as coarse projective integration, coarse fixed-point, and coarse limit-cycle computations. In a second step, we explore an approach to incorporating oscillator heterogeneity in the coarse-graining process. The approach is based on the observation of fast-developing correlations between oscillator state and oscillator intrinsic properties and establishes a connection with tools developed in the context of uncertainty quantification.},

This approach is based on coupling short intervals of direct dynamic network simulation with appropriately-defined lifting and restriction operators, mapping the detailed network description to suitable macroscopic (coarse-grained) variables and back. This enables the acceleration of direct simulations through Coarse Projective Integration (CPI), as well as the identification of coarse stationary states via a Newton-GMRES method. We also demonstrate the use of data-mining, both linear (principal component analysis, PCA) and nonlinear (diffusion maps, DMAPS) to determine good macroscopic variables (observables) through which one can coarse-grain the model. These results suggest methods for decreasing simulation times of dynamic real-world systems such as epidemiological network models. Additionally, the data-mining techniques could be applied to a diverse class of problems to search for a succint, low-dimensional description of the system in a small number of variables.},

The graphs are generated by large-scale individual-based urban traffic simulations built on actual census, land-use and population-mobility data. We find that the contact network among people is a strongly connected small-world-like graph with a well-defined scale for the degree distribution. However, the locations graph is scale-free, which allows highly efficient outbreak detection by placing sensors in the hubs of the locations network. Within this large-scale simulation framework, we then analyse the relative merits of several proposed mitigation strategies for smallpox spread. Our results suggest that outbreaks can be contained by a strategy of targeted vaccination combined with early detection without resorting to mass vaccination of a population.},

Although currently incapable of sustained human-to-human transmission, H5N1 represents a serious pandemic threat owing to the risk of a mutation or reassortment generating a virus with increased transmissibility. Identifying public health interventions that might be able to halt a pandemic in its earliest stages is therefore a priority. Here we use a simulation model of influenza transmission in Southeast Asia to evaluate the potential effectiveness of targeted mass prophylactic use of antiviral drugs as a containment strategy. Other interventions aimed at reducing population contact rates are also examined as reinforcements to an antiviral-based containment policy. We show that elimination of a nascent pandemic may be feasible using a combination of geographically targeted prophylaxis and social distancing measures, if the basic reproduction number of the new virus is below 1.8. We predict that a stockpile of 3 million courses of antiviral drugs should be sufficient for elimination. Policy effectiveness depends critically on how quickly clinical cases are diagnosed and the speed with which antiviral drugs can be distributed.},

	abstract = {The random walk is fundamental to modeling dynamic processes on networks. Metrics based on the random walk have been used in many applications from image processing to Web page ranking. However, how appropriate are random walks to modeling and analyzing social networks? We argue that unlike a random walk, which conserves the quantity diffusing on a network, many interesting social phenomena, such as the spread of information or disease on a social network, are fundamentally non-conservative. When an individual infects her neighbor with a virus, the total amount of infection increases. We classify diffusion processes as conservative and non-conservative and show how these differences impact the choice of metrics used for network analysis, as well as our understanding of network structure and behavior. We show that Alpha-Centrality, which mathematically describes non-conservative diffusion, leads to new insights into the behavior of spreading processes on networks. We give a scalable approximate algorithm for computing the Alpha-Centrality in a massive graph. We validate our approach on real-world online social networks of Digg. We show that a non-conservative metric, such as Alpha-Centrality, produces better agreement with empirical measure of influence than conservative metrics, such as PageRank. We hope that our investigation will inspire further exploration into the realms of conservative and non-conservative metrics in social network analysis.},

One of the most widely used tools for modeling structured data are graphs. An interesting and important challenge is thus to investigate kernels on instances that are represented by graphs. So far, only very specific graphs such as trees and strings have been considered.This paper investigates kernels on labeled directed graphs with general structure. It is shown that computing a strictly positive definite graph kernel is at least as hard as solving the graph isomorphism problem. It is also shown that computing an inner product in a feature space indexed by all possible graphs, where each feature counts the number of subgraphs isomorphic to that graph, is NP-hard. On the other hand, inner products in an alternative feature space, based on walks in the graph, can be computed in polynomial time. Such kernels are defined in this paper.},

The kernel computation finally boils down to obtaining the stationary state of a discrete-time linear system, thus is efficiently performed by solving simultaneous linear equations. Our kernel is based on an infinite dimensional feature space, so it is fundamentally different from other string or tree kernels based on dynamic programming.

In two-dimensions, we focus on the vortex solution in which the particles rotate around a common center and show that this solution can be obtained from random initial conditions, even in the absence of a confining boundary. Furthermore, we develop a continuum version of our discrete model and demonstrate that the agreement between the discrete and the continuum model is excellent.},

Networked cooperative uninhabited autonomous vehicles are being developed for commercial and military applications. Suppose that we refer to all such groups of entities as "social foraging swarms". In order for such multiagent systems to succeed it is often critical that they can both maintain cohesive behaviors and appropriately respond to environmental stimuli (e.g., by optimizing the acquisition of nutrients in foraging for food). In this paper, we characterize swarm cohesiveness as a stability property and use a Lyapunov approach to develop conditions under which local agent actions will lead to cohesive foraging even in the presence of "noise" characterized by uncertainty on sensing other agent's position and velocity, and in sensing nutrients that each agent is foraging for. The results quantify earlier claims that social foraging is in a certain sense superior to individual foraging when noise is present, and provide clear connections between local agent-agent interactions and emergent group behavior. Moreover, the simulations show that very complicated but orderly group behaviors, reminiscent of those seen in biology, emerge in the presence of noise.},

They enable the application of kernel methods, such as support vector machines, to the analysis and classification of graphs, for example, chemical compounds. These graph kernels are obtained by marginalizing a kernel between paths with respect to a random walk model on the graph vertices along the edges. We propose two extensions of these graph kernels, with the double goal to reduce their computation time and increase their relevance as measure of similarity between graphs. First, we propose to modify the label of each vertex by automatically adding information about its environment with the use of the Morgan algorithm. Second, we suggest a modification of the random walk model to prevent the walk from coming back to a vertex that was just visited. These extensions are then tested on benchmark experiments of chemical compounds classification, with promising results.},

In this paper we present a matching algorithm based on a fixpoint computation that is usable across different scenarios. The algorithm takes two graphs (schemas, catalogs, or other data structures) as input, and produces as output a mapping between corresponding nodes of the graphs. Depending on the matching goal, a subset of the mapping is chosen using filters. After our algorithm runs, we expect a human to check and if necessary adjust the results. As a matter of fact, we evaluate the `accuracy' of the algorithm by counting the number of needed adjustments. We conducted a user study, in which our accuracy metric was used to estimate the labor savings that the users could obtain by utilizing our algorithm to obtain an initial matching. Finally, we illustrate how our matching algorithm is deployed as one of several high-level operators in an implemented testbed for managing information models and mappings.},

Furthermore, assuming that data points are random samples from a density p(x) = e-U(x) we identify these eigenvectors as discrete approximations of eigenfunctions of a Fokker-Planck operator in a potential 2U(x) with reflecting boundary conditions. Finally, applying known results regarding the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the continuous Fokker-Planck operator, we provide a mathematical justification for the success of spectral clustering and dimensional reduction algorithms based on these first few eigenvectors. This analysis elucidates, in terms of the characteristics of diffusion processes, many empirical findings regarding spectral clustering algorithms.},

The approach is centered around a fundamental result proved by Motzkin and Straus in the mid-1960s, and recently expanded in various ways, which allows us to formulate the maximum clique problem in terms of a standard quadratic program. The attractive feature of this formulation is that a clear one-to-one correspondence exists between the solutions of the quadratic program and those in the original, combinatorial problem. To solve the program we use the so-called replicator equations-a class of straightforward continuous-and discrete-time dynamical systems developed in various branches of theoretical biology. We show how, despite their inherent inability to escape from local solutions, they nevertheless provide experimental results that are competitive with those obtained using more elaborate mean-field annealing heuristics.},

The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs—30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers—a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

Through reduction to a Sylvester equation we improve the time complexity of kernel computation between unlabeled graphs with n vertices from O(n6) to O(n3). We find a spectral decomposition approach even more efficient when computing entire kernel matrices. For labeled graphs we develop conjugate gradient and fixed-point methods that take O(dn3) time per iteration, where d is the size of the label set. By extending the necessary linear algebra to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) we obtain the same result for d-dimensional edge kernels, and O(n4) in the infinite-dimensional case; on sparse graphs these algorithms only take O(n2) time per iteration in all cases. Experiments on graphs from bioinformatics and other application domains show that these techniques can speed up computation of the kernel by an order of magnitude or more. We also show that certain rational kernels (Cortes et al., 2002, 2003, 2004) when specialized to graphs reduce to our random walk graph kernel. Finally, we relate our framework to R-convolution kernels (Haussler, 1999) and provide a kernel that is close to the optimal assignment kernel of kernel of Fröhlich et al.

This measure is then applied to the task of graph matching.},
